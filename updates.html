      <p>Let me share with you my experience of how working in college laid the 
        <br>foundation for my future. While I was at BYU, I was a Near Eastern Studies 
        <br>major and spent three years as a research assistant for a faculty member 
        <br>in my department. There are two ways this job helped prepare me for my 
        <br>future. In one way, l developed skills as an employee that I still use today. 
        <br>I learned how to work independently on assigned projects, meet weekly deadlines, 
        <br>write professionally, and understand the publication process for books and articles.</p>
      <p>Beyond that, this professor also became somewhat of a mentor to me. He gave me 
        <br>advice and helped me navigate my way to a master’s program in Jewish Studies. 
        <br>It was while I was in graduate school that I decided to become a librarian. After 
        <br>I graduated from my master’s program, I pulled out some of his application 
        <br>suggestions again to use for library school and my applications to grad school 
        <br>round 2 were even better than before. Eventually I made my way to BYU-Idaho and 
        <br>became the Religion librarian based on my past education and work experience. You 
        <br>never know how what you do now will directly impact your future.</p>
