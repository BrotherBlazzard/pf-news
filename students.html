        <p>Kyle Autrey<br><br>"I'm from Fort Worth, Texas, I enjoy being outside: hiking, 
          <br>swimming, mountain biking, spelunking, walking the dog, etc. 
          <br>I enjoy working on my truck (not spending the money, but 
          <br>finishing projects on it is very satisfying). I'm talking with a few 
          <br>companies right now so I can't say exactly what I'll be doing 
          <br>when I graduate but whatever it is, it'll be great! I plan on 
          <br>going back to school to get an MBA in a few years. I'm very 
          <br>grateful that I was able to work at the library for the last 2 
          <br>years. Because of working here, I've grown hard skills in 
          <br>leadership, problem-solving, communication, budgeting, goal 
          <br>setting, scheduling, innovation, and so many others. I'm also 
          <br>grateful for everyone helping out and being so kind to my 
          <br>family these last few semesters especially while Dani was at 
          <br>work. It's been a huge blessing for us. Please keep in touch!"</p>
